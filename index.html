                    <p> Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. I have a bachelors in Psychology from Keene State and have worked in medical devices for the past six years. I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through the University of New Hampshire. I am here to change my career and my life! </p>
                        
                    <br>

                        <p> Since I was a kid I've had a knack for computers, starting my journey on DOS. I've found myself as the go to "troubleshooter"for my respective teams during my work experience. Can't get your computer to turn on/off? Ask Jess. SAP is giving a strange error message? Ask Jess. We need someone to help with validation? Ask Jess. </p>
